        <h6>Project Manager</h6>
        <h7>David Stanek</h7>
        <br/>
        <p>
        	Following over a decade of human services, including working with the mentally ill and teaching middle school, David Stanek transitioned into project and customer relationship management at engineering firms and Silicon Valley start ups.  With a BS degree in Human Development from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, and his tenacity for cycling, soccer and the outdoors, David brought his customer centric philosophy and team spirit to Kubeworks in 2010.  "Being the hub of communication, interfacing effectively with clients (and their customers), and lightening their work load by managing data and services; that's rewarding to me," said David about his role as project and attendee manager for Dow Corning's international sales training program 2011.  The same enthusiasm and determination that found David cycling across the United States can be found in his business and interpersonal practices.  "The planning and logistics that go into teaching 120 kids, or being on a bicycle for 4 months translate very well to project management, but being innately empathetic towards others has really taken me places."
