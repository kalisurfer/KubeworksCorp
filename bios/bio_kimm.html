        <br/>
        <p>
        	Kimm has been in the Travel/Hospitality Industry for over 15 years.  Her career began with the airlines which gave her the opportunity to travel around the world.  After nearly 3 years of being a flight attendant, she grew tired of a life on the road. But the travel bug had bitten and she wanted to stay within the industry so she took a job with a major hotel chain as a conference service manager.  In the late 90's Kimm jumped from the hotel side of the business to the corporate side, by becoming a meeting planner for a large travel company.   It is here where Kimm met Lisa Scott and become experienced with various meeting planning software.  With raising a family, once again life on the road as a planner became hectic, so it was a perfect fit when Lisa offered her an opportunity with Kubeworks.  Kimm is a transplanted New Yorker and currently resides in the southern laid-back city of Richmond, Virginia.
