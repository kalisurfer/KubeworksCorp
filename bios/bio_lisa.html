        <h6>CEO & Founder</h6>
        <h7>Lisa Scott</h7>
        <br/>
        <p> Lisa Scott co-founded Kubeworks, Inc in 1999 as a two-man web design/development shop.  With her feet firmly planted in both the digital and meeting industry, she saw a need for a business that bridged the gap. Thus, in 2006 transitioned Kubeworks to specialize on websites for meeting &amp; events.  Since then, she has grown it to a thriving business with over 100 clients from Fortune 100 companies to independent event planners and has satellite offices throughout the United States. </p>
